# Finder
While You need to find your sentence or a word or a list of sentences/words in a long text.
You can create a folder and insert Finder.py in it and gather all words you want to search them in list.txt file and put main content in sample.txt file then run Python code.

* if you have many content files you can add a loop in your code to read one by one and try to seek your lists.
